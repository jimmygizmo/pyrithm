# pyrithm
Fundamental algorithms, data structures and design patterns implemented in Python 3. Design and usage demonstrated and explained.

Pyrithm is structured like a tutorial with a lot of code comments and docstrings to explain things
and assist learning, in both the pyrithm package/module code as well as the executable example
code. There are two types of examples to learn from; examples which import pyrithm modules and
demonstrate the usage of those pyrithm modules, and examples which do not import pyrithm modules but rather contain all definitions, self-contained within the example file.

Examples are like mini-tutorials, or the code which would go along with a written or video tutorial.

examples_pyrithm
----------------
These examples import corresponding modules from the pyrithm package and illustrate the topic area
in this way. Of course they may also make use of other imports.

examples_standalone
-------------------
These examples are self-contained and do not import anything from pyrithm, although they might import
modules from the standard library or perhaps even other modules.

Why the difference?
It is just a matter of organizing code and timing. Some of the standalone examples may evolve a
little in the future and have pyrithm modules written to support them. A first step can be to just
write a standalone example to get started and when it is apparent that in implementation can be
done in a nice, resusable modular fashion, then that can be done and the example can be moved into
examples_pyrithm. Some examples or 'mini-tutorials' might be totally suitable to remain standalone.
